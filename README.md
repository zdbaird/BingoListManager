# BingoListManager

BingoListManager is a tool for managing bingo lists that I barely did shit for and had copilot make 90% of (including this readme).

## What Does BingoListManager Do?
BingoListManager is a simple desktop application designed to help you create, edit, and manage lists for bingo games. It allows you to:
- Create new bingo lists for any theme to be used on [Bingosync](https://bingosync.com) or other bingo platforms (if the format is supported)
- Edit existing lists by adding, removing, or reordering items
- Save and load bingo lists for future use
- Save states for lists to adjust which items are included in the game

The program is intended for anyone who wants to organize and customize bingosync games easily, without needing to manually manage text files or spreadsheets.

## How to Use
- Download the latest installer from the GitHub Releases page.
- Run the installer to install BingoListManager on your Windows system.

If you want to build the installer yourself:
